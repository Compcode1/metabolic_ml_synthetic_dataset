This project successfully generated a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 250,000 adults, which mirrors the real-world health metrics of the U.S. adult population. By leveraging the detailed data distributions from NHANES (CDC), we created a dataset that accurately reflects key metabolic health variables such as Age, BMI, Waist Circumference, Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), Triglycerides, HDL Cholesterol, and High Blood Pressure.

Each health metric was crafted using a combination of probabilistic models, age and gender adjustments, and algorithmic simulations. This process ensured that the data closely aligns with real-world distributions, creating a valuable resource for data engineering, machine learning, and health research projects. The large size of the dataset and its realistic variability offer significant potential for training machine learning models and conducting simulations in a privacy-compliant way.

Through the use of advanced algorithms, this dataset not only provides a foundation for research into metabolic syndrome and associated health risks but also addresses the gap in the availability of health-related synthetic data that maintains real-world fidelity. By making such data readily accessible, this project can support a wide range of applications in healthcare, public health, insurance, and academic research, offering a realistic and scalable alternative to sensitive real-world health datasets.

The final product, a clean, 250,000-row synthetic dataset, stands as a key asset for organizations looking to explore, predict, and model metabolic health conditions under realistic conditions, free from privacy concerns.
